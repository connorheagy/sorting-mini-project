Resources used: Evening tutors - helped me understand the workflow and the syntax of java.
One-paragraph Description of using ChatGPT for part 5: I found ChatGBT useful and interesting to se for part 5. My experience was interesting because it created code that I hadn't thought it would. Instead of creating a very fast and efficent algorithm for sorting, it created a fairly slow one. However, I decided I could tweak the design to make it cleaner. I did this by asking itself to improve the code, which it did. I made more concise decisions in syntax and also made the code more generic. I would rate my experinece using it as a good one.
